We have just begun a subscription memberships system, through which you can
financially support the PlanetMath organization and community on an ongoing
basis (click the previous link to enter the system).

There are perks to supporting financially in this manner:
\begin{itemize}
\item voting rights -- for site administration, community development, and
      governance issues.
\item being listed on our "great wall" of donors
\item receiving the PlanetMath quarterly newsletter.
\item news, announcements, and other updates concerning the community and the
      nonprofit.
\item potential "goodies" in the future, as we can afford them (e.g., the
      encyclopedia in print, t-shirts, etc.)
\item meeting/symposium discounts (anticpiated).
\item of course, satisfaction in helping materially support PlanetMath!
\end{itemize}
We strongly encourage friends of PlanetMath who believe in free knowledge (in
all senses) for mathematics (and beyond) to become a member, at least at the
minimum level (\$20/yr). A steady revenue stream holds the promise of a much
greater ability of the PlanetMath community to sustain, grow, develop and
attain much greater impact.
One time donations can also be performed via PayPal (which also accepts credit)
through the above system, or via one of the methods described below.
