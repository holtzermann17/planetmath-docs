Following up on what I sent you yesterday, today I was thinking
of a minimal plan.  This one is a plan for how to build up our
educational enterprise in the absence of outside investors or
grants by ramping up our own efforts.  The bottom line is that,
if we add an extra year, we could get to the point of teaching
20 classes through PM.

The starting point for this plan is the calculus course I hope
to be teaching this fall.  Let's suppose that it succeeds and 
we find 15 students who are willing to pay $5 per session to 
attend and are satisfied with the result.  As we discussed,
running this first course isn't going to cost us anything in
terms of hiring staff or the like since we will do it using
existing soft and can take of the administrative load ourselves.

I am thinking of stretching this scenario a little.  Supposing 
that one class succeeds, I could see myself teaching 4 classes
of similar size --- that's a typical load for a junior faculty
member.  As long as I'm getting paid, I could work full-time;
since teaching the classes, answering questions, and preparing
lessons would be half-time, I could use time form the other 
half to take care of the administrative work associated with
this. (According to yeaterday's estimate, it shouldn't come out
to much more than an hour a day or so.)  The Linode and 
Waterloo server should be able to take care of 60 students,
so we shouldn't need any new expenses for more extensive
hardware or software platform to handle 1 teacher and 60
students in the form of 4 classes.

Going with our fee of $5 per session, $2 of which would go to
PM and $3 of which would go to me, that would mean that over
the course of a year, I would get $21,600 and PM would get
$14.400.  Given my cisrcumstances, I could work full-time for
a year with a salary like that.  As for PM, having that sum
in the bank would allow it to move to the next step, hire a
programmer and start working toward teaching 20 classes; as
I mentioned the other day. looking over the spreadsheet, it
showed that, since we would only go in the hole $7500 during
the first year, an investment on the order or $14,400 should
be sufficient to get the plan going.

Here is a sketch of the finances (assumes more gradual
ramp-up):  

qtr enrollment teacher  PM  balance programmer sysadmin
 0   15         1350    900    900      0           0
 1   30         2700   1800   2700      0           0
 2   45         4050   2700   5400      0           0
 3   60         5400   3600   9000      0           0
 4   60         5400   3600  12600      0           0
 5   60         5400   3600  11200   5000           0
 6   60         5400   3600   9800   5000           0
 7   60         5400   3600   8400   5000           0
 8   60         5400   3600   7000   5000           0
 9   90         8100   5400   4400   5000        3000
10  120        10800   7200   3600   5000        3000
11  150        13500   9000   4600   5000        3000
12  180        16200  10800   7400   5000        3000

So the basic premise is that, after the calculus class
this fall, I would add a class each quarter until I got
to 4 classes and stick with teaching 4 classes for the
duration of the second year.  During the second year, 
we would hire a programmer to work for $20,000 a year,
during which time the program for handling multiple
classes and teachers would be ready.  Thus, for the 
third year, we could hire a system adminstrator for
$8,000 a year part-time and have multiple teachers 
teaching a dozen classes.
