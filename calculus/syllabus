Introduction

Calculus is the branch of mathematics which deals with rates and change.
In algebra, one considers problems involving constant rates of change
such as "If a cat runs at 10 miles per hour and a dog runs at 15 miles
per hour, how long will it take for the dog to catch up with the cat if
the dog starts out 20 feet behind the cat?".  However, those techniques
only work for steady motion so, for instance, they would no longer 
apply to a more realistic version of the problem which takes into account
the fact that the animals don't instantly start running at top speed, but
require some time to get up to speed.

In order to cope with non-constant rates of change, we need to augment
our algebraic techniques with the concept of limit of a quantity.  Roughly
speaking, if a quantity y depends on a quantity x, then the limit of y is
the value which y approaches (but might not actually reach) as x behaves in
a certain way (such as becoming very small or very large or approaching
some specific value).  Once we have this concept of limit, we can then use 
it to define the processes of differentiation, in which we compute the 
instantaneous rate of change and integration, where we compute a quantity
from its instantaneous rate of change.

As it turns out, these same techniques of limits, differentiation, and
integration are also applicable to studying the geometry of curved lines
and surfaces.  We will use them to compute tangents, areas, and volumes 
of various shapes.

In this class, we will focus on two topics: learning and mastering the
techniques for computing limits, derivatives and integrals and applying
those techniques to real-world problems.  We will start out with simple
instances involving elementary algebra in order to become acquainted with
the new concepts, then gradually push forward to more advanced techniques
and applications involving exponential, logarithms, trigonometry, and the
like.

Prerequisites

Algebra:  This is the most important prerequisite since, as described above,
most of what we will be doing are algebraic manuipulations involving limits.
To get the most out the course, you should be proficientin manupulating powers,
polynomials and rational functions, factoring, expanding, collecting terms, 
and the like.

Geometry:  Aside from a general familiarity with Euclidean goemetry, you
should know how to plot curves and surfaces on a grid.

Trigonometry:  We will make use of trigonometric functions, exponentials, 
and logarithms, so familiarity with them will be assumed.  However, since 
this will not happen until relatively late in the course, there is plenty 
of time for someone who is not familiar with these topics to pick up
sufficient backround information; ask the instructor for recommendations 
on background reading.

Methodology

We will make use of a number of learning resources to teach this course.
It is not expected that every student will make use of every resource
listed here; rather, the idea is that, since different people learn
better in different ways, the student will pick and choose those resources
which fit the student's learning style.
