Introduction

Calculus is the branch of mathematics which deals with rates and change.
In algebra, one considers problems involving constant rates of change
such as "If a cat runs at 10 miles per hour and a dog runs at 15 miles
per hour, how long will it take for the dog to catch up with the cat if
the dog starts out 20 feet behind the cat?".  However, those techniques
only work for steady motion so, for instance, they would no longer 
apply to a more realistic version of the problem which takes into account
the fact that the animals don't instantly start running at top speed, but
require some time to get up to speed.

In order to cope with non-constant rates of change, we need to augment
our algebraic techniques with the concept of limit of a quantity.  Roughly
speaking, if a quantity y depends on a quantity x, then the limit of y is
the value which y approaches (but might not actually reach) as x behaves in
a certain way (such as becoming very small or very large or approaching
some ther value).  Once we have this concept of limit, we can then use it
to define the processes of differentiation, in which we compute the 
instantaneous rate of change and integration, where we compute a quantity
from its instantaneous rate of change.

In this class, we will focus on two topics: learning and mastering the
techniques for computing limits, derivatives and integrals and applying
those techniques to real-world problems.
