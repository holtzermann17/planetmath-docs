PlanetMath.org is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit, incorporated in the state of
Virginia.

Aaron Krowne got the website off the ground in 2001 and completed his
"PlanetMath thesis" in 2003 at Virginia Tech. PlanetMath.org, Ltd. was
incorporated the same year, and granted tax exempt status 2004. In 2006, we
became part of the Google Summer of Code program, which funded a series of
enhancements to PlanetMath's linking system, and a new rating and reputation
system, among other projects. In recent years, we contracted with the IMS and
Berkeley CPAM to make other improvements to Noosphere.

Our programming team is currently finishing up a set of enhancements to the
editorial and moderation facilities in Noosphere, under contract with Springer.
We are also helping build the Bibliographic Knowledge Network, a project funded
by an NSF and managed by Jim Pitman at UC-Berkeley.

A lot of the things we want to work on, both in software development and
community projects, will require both increased funding and better
organization. As we go forward, the way our content is licensed, the way we
facilitate editorial work, and even the centrality of the encyclopedia on
PlanetMath will all be questioned, and possibly revised. Our organization will
need an active staff if we are going to make effective changes in these or
other areas. For the immediate future, expect to see us focused on becoming a
better-functioning organization.
