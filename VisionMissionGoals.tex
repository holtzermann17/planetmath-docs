Our aim is to provide a free website that increasingly serves the comprehensive
scholarly needs of all users of mathematics.
Our website relies on a software platform that emphasizes peer-based review and
teaching. Anyone can contribute to the site. We continue to improve the
software on behalf of the website's users, to better serve their diverse needs
and interests.

Our site's content is developed and improved on a volunteer basis by the user
community, under a site-wide "minimal rights reserved" license. This
foundational choice is the basis of our extended effort to cater to our
community's creative ideas about how to learn and do mathematics.
We support research and outreach activites in areas related to our mission, in
order to provide the best possible collaborative software and help our
community develop widely-useful learning materials.
